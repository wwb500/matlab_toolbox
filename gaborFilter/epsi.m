% - Equal-performance SNR increase v1.0 -
%
% This script calculates the increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which
% is needed on average in order to make System2 perform as well as System1.
% If the equal-performance SNR increase (EPSI) is positive the SNR needs
% to be increased, which would indicate that System2 is less robust than
% System1. A negative EPSI would inidcate that System2 is more robust than
% System1 because the SNR for System2 needs to be decrased to match the
% average recognition performance of System1 and System2.
% A detailed explanation is given in [1].
